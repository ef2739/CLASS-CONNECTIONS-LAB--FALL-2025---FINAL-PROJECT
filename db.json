      "msg": "I’ve spent my life on buses. On winter mornings, when condensation fogs the windows, and on summer evenings, when the sky turns purple and my legs stick to the plastic seats. I’ve spent my life on buses. And I remember every time I’ve felt that look. Not a look, that look. The one that makes you feel dirty even when you’ve done nothing; that opens a black pit in your stomach and makes you ask, what now?; that makes you hope he’ll go away, that he’ll go away, that he’ll get distracted, that maybe the driver stopped too suddenly, that maybe he didn’t mean to rub against you, didn’t mean to touch you with his unfamiliar hands. I’ve spent my life on buses. Sad moments, happy moments, careless moments, alone, with friends, sober, drunk, dressed chastely and not so chastely (though they couldn’t have seen it, because on buses you always cover up, even when you’re wearing short dresses underneath). I’ve spent my life on buses, but there has never been a time when I felt completely safe. And it’s not just the bus. It’s walking home at night as the light drains from the sky, turning off your music so you can listen for footsteps, fingers tight around your keys. It’s feeling exposed to the world’s rapacious gaze even when you wish you were invisible. It’s the knowledge that it doesn’t matter how old you are or how you are dressed—it is never going to cease. You will always feel that look. The phantom of those unfamiliar hands will always hover."
